Project Overview
 This is a Blackjack-with-Ai game created in C++  where the player competes with an AI dealer. The game uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to structure the logic and includes features such as card shuffling, dynamic round progression, and decision-making by the AI dealer.
 
Key features of the game are:
1 Object-Oriented Design: Classes Card, Deck, and Player encapsulate the game logic and data.
2 AI Dealer Logic: Dealer draws cards until the hand value is at least 17.
3 Dynamic Gameplay: Players can choose to hit or stand in each round.
4 Card Shuffling: Randomly shuffles the deck to ensure fairness.
5 Hand Value Adjustment: Automatically adjusts Ace value (1 or 11) to avoid busting.
